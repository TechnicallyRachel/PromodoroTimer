# PromodoroTimer

PomodoroTimer.py and Pomodoro.go are simple Promodoro Timers with a countdown function.
Four 25 minute blocks with 5 minute rests after each block, and one 15 minute rest when the 4th block is completed. 
The cycle is then repeated.

funFactTimer.py is a faster version written so code can be run and seen from beginning to end. One fact for each of the 4 "25 minute" timer sessions.
